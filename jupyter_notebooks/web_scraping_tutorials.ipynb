If you try to keep the old system forever and just patch it repeatedly, that becomes an uphill climb: the longer you maintain a difficult-to-maintain system, the harder it becomes to maintain.

Or that client who decided their code needed to be peer-to-peer instead of client-server. That's also a strong candidate for a rewrite. This happens sometimes, but **having an insurmountable technical issue usually isn't the driving force in rewrites**.

The Perl system was earning them tens of millions of euros and had hundreds of customers. Two years into their rewrite, they were able to shift _two_ of those customers to the Java system and they weren't developing new features for the Perl system. What's worse? Turns out that the problems with the Perl system were due to hiring devs who didn't understand architecture or databases.

The is the flip-side of \"pragmatic programming\" - it is important to be able to get the job delivered on time, but if you don't immediately turn around and do it the right way and the next developer comes along and creates a dependency on having done things the wrong way you have a mess on your hands.

When given a big spec, I usually feel overwhelmed on how to architecture the solution because there are so many things to think about, so I simplify the problem, temporarily ignoring some requirements or even features. When I say \"ignoring\", I mean literally. I start designing, then programming, a first iteration of the thing, totally incomplete, pretending it's the end product. Once I know this iteration is done and solid, I add more stuff from the spec. I study how the existing code must be refactored and changed to host the new requirements (which weren't actually new), which often involves a bit of code rework, and this way I build the next iteration.

The networking code is popping up its own dialog boxes from the middle of nowhere; this should have been handled in the UI code. These problems can be solved, one at a time, by carefully moving code, refactoring, changing interfaces. They can be done by one programmer working carefully and checking in his changes all at once, so that nobody else is disrupted. Even fairly major architectural changes can be done without throwing away the code. On the Juno project we spent several months rearchitecting at one point: just moving things around, cleaning them up, creating base classes that made sense, and creating sharp interfaces between the modules. But we did it carefully, with our existing code base, and we didn’t introduce new bugs or throw away working code.\n",
      "\n",
      ">A second reason programmers think that their code is a mess is that it is inefficient. The rendering code in Netscape was rumored to be slow. But this only affects a small part of the project, which you can optimize or even rewrite. You don’t have to rewrite the whole thing. When optimizing for speed, 1% of the work gets you 99% of the bang.\n",
      "\n",
      ">Third, the code may be doggone ugly. One project I worked on actually had a data type called a FuckedString. Another project had started out using the convention of starting member variables with an underscore, but later switched to the more standard “m_”. So half the functions started with “_” and half with “m_”, which looked ugly. Frankly, this is the kind of thing you solve in five minutes with a macro in Emacs, not by starting from scratch.\n",
